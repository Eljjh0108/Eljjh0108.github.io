I am a mechanical engineer at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 2

    This was the first program I worked to a completion, with help from TA in Lab. As an international student, I have never heard of a game called mad lib, so you can imagine my struggle from the start. However, with my lab partner, we managed to code the first ever program of my life and that’s the reason for choosing this lab assignment. 

* Lab 6, part 2 

    In this assignment, I programmed a poker game. I’ve heard of the game, of course, but I’ve never played it so I didn’t know the rules. Prior to class, though, I was assigned to watch a Youtube video about poker and learned about it for the first time. It was an interesting game and it seemed that it relied heavily on luck, despite some people who say it involves math. I chose this for my portfolio because it was fun programming a game that was new to me.

* Lab 9

    I remember this program particularly because I really needed my professor’s help for an error I’ve never experienced in the lab. This occurred because my lab partner and I worked separately on different computers. After we completed them, we uploaded the code to the same repository, resulting in some pretty big and complicated problems that even the TA struggled with. Fortunately, with the assistance of my professor, I was able to solve the problem and submit it in time.
